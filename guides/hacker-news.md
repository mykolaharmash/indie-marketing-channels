## Writing Your Title

To successfully launch on Hacker News, start by posting something you've made that people can try right away, without needing invites or waiting. Your title must start with `Show HN:` and then tell people what you made. Avoid exaggerated or overly promotional titles.

Strong examples:

- "Show HN: I made a tool that helps you learn piano"
- "Show HN: I built a privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics"

Weak examples:

- "Show HN: The best app you'll ever use!!!"
- "Show HN: Revolutionary new way to analyze data"

## Your First Comment

Right after posting, write a comment that tells your story.

Tell a personal story: "I kept losing important emails, so I built this email finder."

Explain the problem: "Finding od emails is har because search often misses important messages."

Share how you sovled it: "My tool looks at email patterns and learns which emails matter most to you."

Be honest about limits: "Right now it only works with Gmail, and it might be slow with very large inboxes."

## Talking with People

Reply to questions quickly, share details, handle criticism politely, and stay active. Always thank people for their feedback.

Before posting, make sure your product works, loads fast, and has clear instructions. Be ready for lots of visitors. Avoid mistakes like marketing talk, being defensive, hiding how it works, or reposting if it flops.

Focus on honest discussions and what you learnedâ€”it's worth more than upvotes!
